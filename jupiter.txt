Jupiter is a gas giant planet with no surface and I focused on it for my phd so ask any questions you'd like.

Jupiter's banded structure is believed to be caused by large scale vertical motion in different zonal wind shear zones and related to convective activity that change the cloud compoistion and structure with latitude.
